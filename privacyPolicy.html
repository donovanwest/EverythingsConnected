            This app does not store any user data. Signing in is purely optional. 
            The only benefit to signing in is that you can add your followed artists and 
            the mini song player might be more likely to be able to play the song connecting two artists 
            (this is because of some market region shenanigans). If you do sign in, it only gives access to
            your followed artists, and your most basic account information like your 
            email, profile pic, subscription tier, etc. I don't take any of that account info, just your followed
            artists when you click the button.

            You can view the source code for the 
            client side app <a href="https://github.com/donovanwest/EverythingsConnected">here</a>. 
            There is also a small api that is used to get a Spotify access token that has to be separate 
            so that my client secret isn't exposed. There's not much to it, but you can find the code 
            <a href="https://github.com/donovanwest/SpotifyAccessToken">here</a>.
