    <h1>About Everything's Connected</h1>
    <p>
        This project was made by Donovan West for the senior project class at Kansas State University. I worked on
        it throughout the fall 2020 semester. I've been updating it a bit in my spare time since then. 
        For more details on how to use the app check <a href="guide.html">here</a>.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        I had a vague idea for this early in 2020. I noticed that a lot of artists that I liked had 
        worked with each other in some way, so I wanted to make a graph to represent that. I made the 
        following image in May:

    <p>
        I made it using LucidChart. It took me about two days between research and tweaking visuals,
        then I hit the shape limit on the free version and I even had to leave off some artists. I 
        kept thinking that there must be a way to do it automatically with the Spotify API.
        Over the summer I starting working on it in C# and got a basic version of the algorithm
        working, but it was very slow. It took like 35 minutes to complete, and I didn't even know
        how I would display it. Then when I started the Fall 2020 semester I decided to 
        use this idea again for my senior project. If you want to look at the source code,
        the repo is up on Github <a href="https://github.com/donovanwest/EverythingsConnected">here</a>.
        I've never used Javascript before, so don't make fun of my code too much.

        The name Everything's Connected is inspired by a lyric in the Lemon Demon song Redesign Your Logo <br>

        Ironically, Lemon Demon has a complete network of only 6, and those were just people that remixed his music and tagged
        him as an artist so it wasn't really a true collaboration.

    <h2>Other Stuff</h2>
    <p>
        If you want to look at something else I've made, you can check out the game I helped make called <a href="https://veweaver.itch.io/my-communist-boyfriend">My Communist Boyfriend</a>
        It's a dating sim where you date various communist and fascist dictators.
    </p>
    <p>
        So far the artist with the most connections I've found is Bach with 2700. This is because whenever an orchestra plays one of his works, they tag him.
        The most connections from a regular living artist I've found is Lil Wayne with 614. 
        Let me know if you find someone that breaks either of those records.

        If you want to contact me about something to do with the app like a bug, a cool thing you found, or maybe even a business inquiry, 
        you can message me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/donovan_west">@donovan_west</a>.
        You could also submit an issue on the Github linked above.
