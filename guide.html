        Go back to the app <a href="index.html">here</a>
    </p>
    <h2>What it Does</h2>
    <p>
        This app allows you to find all the artists that someone has collaborated with on Spotify.
        It uses the Spotify API to scan through all 
        of an artist's songs and pull out every artist that was featured on them. You then have to ability to
        do the same thing to any those artists, and create a big network showing how a lot of artists have
        some connection to another. It's kinda like the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">Kevin Bacon Number</a> 
        thing. The only reason you should need to sign in is to add your followed artists.
        If you want to learn more about the app or myself you can look <a href="about.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Search for Artist or Playlist</h3>
    <p>
        Type any artist's name in the text box and press Enter 
        or the search button. Their circle will appear, then it will do a search for all of their collaborators. Depending
        on how prolific the artist is, this could take a few seconds. For smaller artists, their name might get
        superseded by a more popular one. In that case you can also enter a link to an artist copied from Spotify. Finally, you can also enter a link to 
        a playlist, and every artist in that playlist will be added and searched depending on the settings below.
    </p>
    <h3>Add Followed Artists</h3>
    <p>
        Requires signing in. Adds every artist you follow to the screen. By default none of them are expanded so you can try to connect them yourself.
        If you put on Full Search with one degree and don't Show Leaves, then you can see how your followed artists are directly connected.
    </p>
    <h3>Add Random Artist</h3>
    <p>
        Adds a random artist to the screen. They will always have connections and have some popularity. Try to 
        keep adding random artists and seeing if you can connect them to your existing network.
    </p>
    <h3>One at a Time Mode</h3>
    <p>
        This will only show the artists within 1 degree of separation from the artist you type, then you can
        click on any of those artists to run the same search on them to expand the network. This is my recommended
        mode since it runs faster and it's easier to see the information. There's also fun in discovering it yourself.
    </p>
    <h3>Full Search Mode</h3>
    <p>
        This will keep doing a recursive search on every artist found up to a certain degrees of separation.
        You can set the degree limit with the slider right below it.
        This can be cool to see the shear number of artists in the network, but it can take a while to load them all, 
        that many artists causes massive lag, 
        and it's hard to see what's going on when there's a couple thousand artists shown.  
        I only recommend going to two degrees unless you know what you're doing or you're willing to wait a while.
    </p>
    <h3>Smart Filter</h3>
    <p>
        Filters out artists that have low popularity or have no image. This will help get rid of some unpopular artists that often times 
        haven't even released their own music but are featured on a song.
    </p>
    <h3>Show Images</h3>
    <p>
        Shows images of the artist in their node. It looks better, but at a high
        volume it can cause extra lag. When this is off each node will be a
        color based on it's degrees of separation from the root.
    </p>
    <h3>Base Circle Size on Popularity</h3>
    <p>
        Spotify assigns every artist a popularity score between 0 and 100. With this setting on, the radius of
        each circle will be equal to that popularity. This can help you pick out the more
        famous artists. If you want equal representation then you can turn this off and 
        each circle will be the same size.
    </p>
    <h3>Show Leaves</h3>
    <p>
        When this is unselected it will only show artists that have more than one connection. Useful for condensing the information
        to more relevant connections and reducing lag. This combos well with a Full Search on an artist or all followed artists to 
        see how dense of a network they create.
    </p>
    <h3>Song connecting the artists</h3>
    <p>
        If you click on the line between two artists, it will show the name of the song they collaborated on
        in the sidebar. It will also play a 30 second sample of that song if it's available, and give a link to open it in Spotify. 
        For some reason Spotify has it set so that preview tracks are more likely to be available if you're signed in.
    </p>
    <h3>Delete</h3>
    <p>
        The trash can icon. Will delete the entire network and start over. (It just refreshes the page shhhh)
    </p>
    <h3>Mute</h3>
    <p>
        Mutes the audio when you click on a link.
    </p>
    <h3>Games You Can Play</h3>
    <p>
        I have fun putting it on the one at a time mode, and trying to find a way to connect two
        disparate artists. Using Random Artist helps for this You'd be amazed at some of the connections you can make with only
        a few degrees.
        <br><br>
        Theoretically with most artists you can go functionally forever expanding nodes until you reach a point where 
        you have virtually every artist represented, but you're browser would probably crash 
        before that happened. I want to put a challenge out there to find the artist with the 
        largest network you can with no more connections to be found. This means expanding every artist 
        until there's no more.
        <br><br>
        Kevin Bacon has appeared on a few movie sound tracks and released music with his brother as The Bacon Brothers. This means
        that you can use this app to find a musician's Bacon Number.
