# EverythingsConnected


This app was made for the senior project class at Kansas State University. The link to the app is here: http://everythings-connected.com. If for some reason that link doesn't work, it's also being hosted by Github pages here: https://donovanwest.github.io/EverythingsConnected/.

For more general information about the app check here: http://everythings-connected.com/about.html.
For information about how to use the app check here: http://everythings-connected.com/guide.html.

You can also easily launch this as a live server yourself since it's just a static webpage.
