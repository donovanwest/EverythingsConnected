# EverythingsConnected


This app was made for the senior project class at Kansas State University. I've been working on it in my spare time since
The link to the app is here: https://everythings-connected.com. If for some reason that link doesn't work, it's also being hosted by Github pages here: https://donovanwest.github.io/EverythingsConnected/.

For more general information about the app check here: https://everythings-connected.com/about.html.
For information about how to use the app check here: https://everythings-connected.com/guide.html.

If anyone has any feedback, suggestions, or bug fixes feel free to contact me or create an issue/pull-request

You can also easily launch this as a live server yourself since it's just a static webpage.
